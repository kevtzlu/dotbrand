## 3. CSI DIVISION COST ALLOCATION (Revised v1.1)

Typical cost allocation for a **Level 2 Moderate Healthcare Renovation** (Behavioral Health focus).

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Div 02** | **Existing Conditions** | **3-5%** | Demolition & Abatement |
| **Div 03** | **Concrete** | **2-4%** | Patching & infill only (unless new foundation) |
| **Div 05** | **Metals** | **12-15%** | **(Increased)** High seismic/liquefaction retrofit costs. |
| **Div 06** | **Wood/Plastics** | **5-8%** | **(Increased)** Extensive backing & millwork. |
| **Div 08** | **Openings** | **12-15%** | **(Doubled)** Anti-ligature hardware & security glazing. |
| **Div 09** | **Finishes** | **12-15%** | Hard lid ceilings, impact-resistant drywall. |

| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | of Direct Trade Costs |

### 3.1. Renovation Specific Allocations (Colton DNA)

For **Healthcare Renovations** (especially Behavioral Health), standard percentages DO NOT apply. Use these forced allocations:

*   **Div 06 (Wood, Plastics, Composites)**:
    *   **Standard**: 1-2%
    *   **Healthcare Reno**: **5-8%** (Critical Driver)
    *   *Reason*: OSHPD requires extensive backing for handrails, wall guards, and equipment. Old framing often needs seismic strapping.

*   **Div 08 (Openings)**:
    *   **Standard**: 4-5%
    *   **Behavioral Health**: **12-15%** (Critical Driver)
    *   *Reason*: Wicket doors, anti-ligature hardware, and security glazing cost 3-4x standard commercial doors.

*   **Div 01 (General Requirements)**:
    *   **Standard**: 8-10%
    *   **OSHPD Reno**: **15-20%** (Critical Driver)
    *   *Reason*: ICRA (Infection Control), IOR (Inspector of Record) coordination, and phased construction extend duration and staffing needs.

SHELL BUILDING STANDARD EXCLUSIONS (UPRITE FL Standard):
  These items are TYPICALLY excluded in FL shell building contracts.
  AI must CONFIRM with GC before including:
  ✗ HVAC equipment (RTU, AHU, controls, power, condensate)
  ✗ Slab on Grade + Vapor Barrier (often "by others" per structural)
  ✗ Low voltage systems (data, phone, access control, AV, security)
  ✗ Emergency generators
  ✗ Fire pump (if city pressure adequate)
  ✗ Secondary electrical feeders (if by utility)
  ✗ Permits and plan check fees
  ✗ Bonds (unless explicitly required)
  ✗ Prevailing wage (FL private projects — confirm before adding)
  ✗ LEED / Green Building requirements (unless specified)

SHELL BUILDING STANDARD INCLUSIONS (usually in GC scope):
  ✓ Surveying + Layout
  ✓ Temporary fence + erosion control
  ✓ Fire suppression (design-build)
  ✓ Fire alarm (design-build)
  ✓ Electrical service + panels
  ✓ Plumbing rough-in (shell stub-outs)
  ✓ Roofing (TPO + insulation)
  ✓ Exterior wall cladding (Stucco/Panels — READ ELEVATIONS)
  ✓ RTU Roof curbs (even if RTU excluded)
  ✓ Canopies (if shown on plans — READ DETAILS)
  ✓ Final cleaning

=== GLAZING AREA CALCULATION RULE ===
  DO NOT estimate glazing as % of GFA
  MUST calculate from elevation drawings:
  → Measure each elevation's opening width × height
  → Sum all glazing areas per façade
  → Apply unit cost based on glass type confirmed above
  If elevations not available: use 8–12% of building perimeter × wall height
  and add DISCLAIMER about unconfirmed glazing area
