*   **Scope**: Standard dry storage warehouses, distribution centers, and fulfillment centers.

### **2. NATIONAL WAREHOUSE COST DATABASE (2025-2026)**

#### **2.1 Simple Dry Storage Warehouse**

| Size Range (SF) | Base Cost/SF (Low) | Base Cost/SF (High) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 - 50,000 | $120 | $140 | Small warehouses, high fixed cost allocation |

| 150,001 - 400,000 | $85 | $95 | Large warehouses, moderate scale economics |
| 400,001+ | $75 | $85 | Mega warehouses, maximum scale economics |

#### **2.2 Hybrid Warehouse (Warehouse + Office Mix)**

| Size Range (SF) | Base Cost/SF (Low) | Base Cost/SF (High) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50,000 - 200,000 | $150 | $200 | Office portion (30-50%) increases cost |
| 200,001+ | $120 | $150 | Larger projects benefit from scale economies |

#### **2.3 High-Bay Warehouse (Clear Height > 24 ft)**

| Clear Height | Base Cost/SF (Low) | Base Cost/SF (High) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24-28 ft | $100 | $150 | Standard high-bay |
| 28-32 ft | $150 | $200 | Medium high-bay |

#### **4.1 Regional Multipliers**

*   **California**:
    *   Coastal (LA, Orange County): 1.20x - 1.25x
    *   Inland (Inland Empire, Tustin): 1.15x
    *   Bay Area (SF, Oakland): 1.25x - 1.30x
    *   San Diego: 1.18x
*   **Other Regions**:
    *   TX: 0.90x
    *   UT: 0.98x
    *   NV: 1.02x
    *   NM: 0.88x
    *   National Average: 1.00x

#### **4.2 Code Premiums**

*   **California**: +7% (Seismic Design Category D)
*   **TX/NM**: +1%
*   **UT/NV**: +3%

#### **4.3 Prevailing Wage Multiplier (NEW)**

**CRITICAL**: Prevailing Wage significantly impacts labor costs, especially in California public projects or projects with prevailing wage requirements.

| Scenario | Multiplier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| No Prevailing Wage (Private Project) | 1.00x | Base labor rates |
| Partial Prevailing Wage | 1.10x - 1.20x | Mixed private/public or partial requirements |
| Full Prevailing Wage (Public/Required) | 1.30x - 1.50x | California public works or mandated PW |

**Prevailing Wage by Trade** (California 2025-2026):
- Carpenter: $50/hr → $65-75/hr (1.30-1.50x)
- Ironworker: $55/hr → $70-85/hr (1.27-1.55x)
- Electrician: $60/hr → $80-95/hr (1.33-1.58x)
- Plumber: $55/hr → $75-90/hr (1.36-1.64x)
- Laborer: $40/hr → $55-70/hr (1.38-1.75x)

**Recommended**: Use 1.40x as average for full prevailing wage projects in California.

#### **4.4 Escalation Factor (NEW)**

| Year | Escalation Factor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 1.00x | Baseline |
| 2025 | 1.025x | 2.5% inflation |
| 2026 | 1.050x | 5.0% cumulative |
| 2027 | 1.075x | 7.5% cumulative |

**Note**: Escalation includes general inflation (2-3%) + labor escalation (2-3%) + material volatility (1-2%).

### **5. SOFT COSTS & CONTINGENCY**

#### **5.1 Soft Cost Breakdown**

**Standard Soft Cost**: 15% of Hard Cost (for new build warehouses)

| Component | % of Hard Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A&E (Architecture & Engineering) | 6% | Design, specifications, drawings |
| Permits & Approvals | 2% | Building permits, environmental, etc. |
| Project Management | 4% | PM, scheduling, coordination |
| Insurance & Bonding | 2% | General liability, performance bonds |
| Other (Contingency Planning, etc.) | 1% | Miscellaneous soft costs |
| **Total** | **15%** | **Standard for new build** |

**Adjusted Soft Cost by Project Type**:
- Simple New Warehouse: 12-15%
- Hybrid Warehouse (Office + Warehouse): 15-18%
- High-Bay Warehouse: 15-18%
- Renovation/Adaptive Reuse: 18-25%

#### **5.2 Project Duration Impact on Indirect Costs (NEW)**

**Indirect costs scale with project duration due to extended site overhead, management, and home office costs.**

| Project Duration | Indirect Cost Multiplier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 12 months | 1.0x | Baseline |
| 18 months | 1.06x | 6% increase |
| 24 months | 1.12x | 12% increase (e.g., Advantech) |
| 36 months | 1.24x | 24% increase |

**Formula**: `Duration_Factor = 1 + (0.01 × (Months - 12))`

**Example**: 24-month project → 1 + (0.01 × 12) = 1.12x

#### **5.3 Indirect Cost Breakdown (UPRITE Format)**

| Component | % of Soft Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Field Indirect / General Conditions | 60% | Superintendent, site office, temp utilities |
| Home Office Overhead | 40% | Executive team, accounting, IT, marketing |

#### **5.4 Contingency Guidelines**

**Default Contingency**: 10-15% of (Hard Cost + Soft Cost)

| Risk Level | Contingency % | Trigger Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| LOW | 10-12% | Simple warehouse, good site conditions, no PW |
| MEDIUM | 12-15% | Standard warehouse, some complexity, PW applied |
| HIGH | 15-20% | High-bay, mixed-use, geotechnical unknowns, aggressive schedule |

**Note**: Contingency should be calculated based on Risk Score (see Section 7).

#### **5.5 Monte Carlo Parameters**

*   Steel Price Volatility: O= -10%, M=1.00, P= +20%
*   Labor Productivity: O= -5%, M=1.00, P= +15%
*   Permit Delays: O= 0%, M=1.00, P= +10%
*   Material Escalation: O= -5%, M=1.00, P= +15%
