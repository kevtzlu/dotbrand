################################################################################

building_type_adjustments:
  
  warehouse:
    name: "Warehouse"
    description: "Dry storage, distribution centers, fulfillment centers"
    adjustment_multiplier: 0.9
    rationale: "Warehouses typically have shallow foundations, less sensitive to geotechnical conditions"
    examples: ["Advantech AASC", "Amazon Fulfillment", "DHL Distribution"]
  
  commercial_office:
    name: "Commercial Office"
    description: "Office buildings, corporate headquarters, mixed-use commercial"
    adjustment_multiplier: 1.0
    rationale: "Standard adjustment, baseline for comparison"
    examples: ["Advantech HQ", "Corporate Office", "Mixed-Use Commercial"]
  
  healthcare:
    name: "Healthcare"
    description: "Hospitals, medical offices, clinics"
    adjustment_multiplier: 1.2
    rationale: "Healthcare facilities often require deeper foundations and more stringent geotechnical requirements"
    examples: ["Hospital", "Medical Center", "Specialty Clinic"]

usage_examples:
  
  example_1_advantech_tustin:
    project_name: "Advantech North America Campus"
    location: "Tustin, CA"
    region: "CA_Inland"
    building_type: "commercial_office"
    
    calculation:
      base_adjustment_from_matrix: 0.07
      building_type_multiplier: 1.0
      adjusted_geotechnical_cost: 0.07
      risk_premium: 0.03
      total_adjustment: 0.10
      
      actual_geotechnical_report: 0.06
      variance: "-0.04"
      variance_reason: "Geotechnical report showed better conditions than expected (no liquefaction risk, standard foundations)"

# SECTION 5: CONFIDENCE LEVELS & CAVEATS
################################################################################

confidence_levels:
  HIGH:
    definition: "15+ projects analyzed, statistical confidence > 80%"
    regions: ["CA_Inland", "CA_Coastal", "TX_Inland"]
  
  MEDIUM:
    definition: "5-14 projects analyzed, statistical confidence 50-80%"
    regions: ["CA_Bay_Area", "TX_Coastal", "NY_Urban", "FL_Statewide"]
  
  LOW:
    definition: "< 5 projects analyzed, statistical confidence < 50%"
    regions: ["Emerging regions, new building types"]

caveats:
  - "This matrix is based on historical data and statistical analysis. Actual geotechnical costs may vary significantly based on site-specific conditions."
  - "Always conduct a detailed geotechnical investigation before finalizing cost estimates."
  - "Regional adjustments should be validated against local geotechnical reports and industry experience."
  - "Building type adjustments are approximate and may vary based on specific project requirements."
  - "This matrix should be updated regularly as new project data becomes available."
